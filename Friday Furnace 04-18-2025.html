The Company will restate these financials in its 2024 Form 10-K and future 10-Q filings, and all prior reports, earnings releases, and presentations referencing these statements should also be disregarded. This non-reliance extends to the audit report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (UK), and the Company is actively working to complete its review and corrections promptly.</p>
